The MAE 4272 Blade Design Project encompassed designing wind turbine blades and testing their power output in a wind tunnel. 

Our group had to determine the operating condtion at which to optimize the blades for: chord, span, and pitch. The design had to be tested within the range of the wind tunnel's torque break, and while ensuring the blade's structural integrity within the range rotation speeds.

Design process: Key decisions, iterations, or modeling steps your team performed

Testing summary: How the blades were tested and what data you analyzed

Your contribution: Briefly describe what you worked on

Figures: Plots, CAD image, and photos 


This is how I solved the problem:

```python
    some code = 10;
    plot();
```
