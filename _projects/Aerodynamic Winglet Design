## Overview

This project presents the end-to-end design, optimization, manufacturing, and validation of aerodynamic winglets for a small unmanned aircraft. The winglets were designed to reduce induced drag, improve aircraft range, and serve as a structural integration point for avionics, while remaining lightweight and manufacturable.

The work spans aerodynamic theory, numerical optimization using a Vortex Lattice Method, CAD, CFD validation, prototyping, and qualification testing, culminating in a flight-ready system.

## Project Goals

- Reduce induced drag with minimal parasitic drag penalty  
- Improve lift-to-drag ratio and overall aircraft range  
- Integrate camera and Crossfire antenna into the wingtip  
- Maintain structural integrity under operational loads  
- Conform to 3D printing and CNC manufacturing constraints  

---

## Requirements and Constraints

### Functional Requirements

- Structural strength: winglets must not shear off under aerodynamic or handling loads  
- Avionics mounting: accommodate a 9 mm by 1.5 mm camera and Crossfire antenna  
- Manufacturing envelope: fit within a 250 by 210 by 210 mm build volume  

### Performance Requirements

- Reduce induced drag  
- Maximize lift-to-drag ratio  
- Minimize total system mass

## Aerodynamic Background

Winglets reduce induced drag by weakening wingtip vortices and recovering energy from spanwise flow. A review of prior team aircraft showed that previous designs did not include winglets, leaving a clear opportunity for improvement.

A vertical raked winglet configuration was selected due to its structural simplicity, ease of manufacturing, and common use on RC and UAV platforms. The winglet airfoil was fixed to NACA 6412 to limit design variables and ensure predictable performance.

## Optimization Methodology

### Vortex Lattice Method

Aerodynamic performance was evaluated using Tornado, a MATLAB-based Vortex Lattice Method solver similar to AVL but fully modifiable at the source-code level.

### Automation and Code Modifications

To enable large-scale optimization:

- Removed all interactive geometry prompts  
- Loaded geometry parameters programmatically  
- Added mass and range calculations  
- Implemented constrained nonlinear optimization  

Each simulation originally required approximately five minutes, making manual iteration impractical. Automation enabled efficient exploration of the design space.

### Design Variables

- Top winglet height  
- Bottom winglet height  
- Quarter-chord sweep angle (top and bottom)  
- End chord (taper)  

### Constraints

- Individual winglet heights greater than zero  
- Combined winglet height less than or equal to 0.21 m  
- End chord greater than or equal to zero  
- Sweep angles bounded to avoid unmanufacturable geometry  

---

## Weight Modeling

Winglet mass was explicitly included in the optimization to prevent unrealistic aerodynamic gains.

- Winglet volume calculated analytically using fitted airfoil equations  
- Triple integrals used to estimate volume as a function of geometry  
- Mass computed using material density and infill percentage  

This allowed direct trade-offs between aerodynamic benefit and weight penalty.

## Optimal Winglet Design

The constrained optimization produced the following configuration.

Top winglet:
- Height: 0.11 m  
- Quarter-chord sweep: 1.03 rad  
- End chord: 0 m  

Bottom winglet:
- Height: 0.10 m  
- Quarter-chord sweep: 0.60 rad  
- End chord: 0.154 m  

Predicted results:
- Approximately 20 percent theoretical increase in range  
- Approximately 300 g system mass for pure winglets at 20 percent infill

## CAD and Structural Integration

The winglet was divided into two functional regions.

- Structural section: PLA, carries loads and fasteners  
- Aerodynamic section: lightweight foam or PLA Aero  

Key integration features include bolted attachment into a reinforced outer wing rib, M2 heat-set inserts for camera mounting, and internal routing for the Crossfire antenna.

## Prototyping and Manufacturing

Multiple prototypes were fabricated to refine fit, tolerances, insert placement, structural durability, and electronics integration.

Manufacturing methods explored include:

- PLA and PLA Aero 3D printing  
- CNC-cut foam at multiple densities  

Iterative prototyping led to a robust and serviceable design suitable for competition use.

## CFD Validation

Final designs were validated using ANSYS Fluent.

- Simplified wing geometry imported from SolidWorks  
- Refined mesh near the winglet junction  
- One-degree effective incidence modeled via freestream direction  

### Results

| Configuration   | Lift (N) | Drag (N) | Mass (kg) | Range Score |
|-----------------|----------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| No winglets     | 218.5    | 11.98    | 23.28     | 0.7835      |
| With winglets   | 244.6    | 12.96    | 23.46     | 0.8050      |

This corresponds to an approximately 2.7 percent increase in range score at cruise conditions.
